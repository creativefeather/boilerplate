# Native
* Is there an automatic way to get the installed electron version?
* Maybe seperate out the native tasks into their own gulpfile.
* electron-rebuild didn't do what I wanted it to; but, look at source code to learn something.
* clean-up the native source code and provide a better set of initial examples
* Maybe have the native code do something more interesting.

# Example App
* Create a big clock that displays in the background.
